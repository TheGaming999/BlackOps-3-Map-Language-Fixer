## ðŸ“œ Example Output:
```plaintext
Copied 'en_zm_wonderguns.ff' as 'ea_zm_wonderguns.ff'
Copied 'en_zm_wonderguns.xpak' as 'ea_zm_wonderguns.xpak'
(SND) Copied 'zm_wonderguns.en.sabl' as 'zm_wonderguns.ea.sabl'
(SND) Copied 'zm_wonderguns.en.sabs' as 'zm_wonderguns.ea.sabs'
```

âš  Notes:
* Running the tool as Administrator is necessary for automatic library detection.
* If language detection fails, manually set the Steam library folder and try again.
* If t7patch is found, it will be launched before the game.
* Settings are saved. If you open the tool again, you only need to click "FIX" or "FIX AND RUN"â€”no need to set everything up again.
